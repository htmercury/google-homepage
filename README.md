# From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

First application of HTML5 and CSS3 skills learned to reconstruct the google search page.

The links don't go anywhere and the search box doesn't do anything when you submit it.
The goal was to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.
